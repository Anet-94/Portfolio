## About me
Nowadays, IT is a very popular sphere, so nothing strange that I am interested QA as a first step in it. I am working for now, but my work is not interested for me anymore because I don't feel that I can develop myself there. Another and not less important reason is the salary which is Ukrainian and not enough for living abroad, so I decided that it's my chance for a new life.
